# yt-dlp_text_interface
A small batch program to interact with an existing install of yt-dlp in your system.

### Functionality
When executed, a console window will prompt you to:
1. decide if you want to download an mp3 or mp4
2. if mp4, choose between 4 levels of quality, from 360p to 1080p

**You NEED to install both yt-dlp and ffmpeg and register them to the PATH environment variable on your system.**
